# X-Vanilla 
After Noticing the massively increased Performance, Smoothness and general feel of Gaming on CS:GO on Linux I have devized a System for E-Sports (Pro Players to compete on) lets face it everything is better on Linux.

Custom Linux based pro gaming platform for use with AMD devices ONLY with a bias to minimal input-lag/Response time combined at modern day speeds.

the system will offer a intranet closed circuit server to connect all connected Players & Computers with no internet access.

AMD Based Systems only (as per current speeds lowest input lag according to my data) - Can be ammended if this changes in coming generations.

will utalise a ping protocol to ensure that the speeds are neutral across the Net of users.

a self analysis tool to fine tune settings for optimal Speeds and image Quality (as per Programme)

Example Systems Connected: ASUS ROG Crosshair X870E Hero (Motherboard), Powercolour Liquid Devil AMD RX7900XTX (x2), Trident Z5 RGB 128GB (X4@32GB@DDR5) F5-6000J3636F32GX2-TZ5RK, AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D 4.2 GHz 145MB, ASUS ROG Thor 1600W Titanium (PSU), Lian Li Galahad II Performance 360 (AIO), Lian Li Odyssey X (Chassi), Corsair iCUE COMMANDER CORE XT (RGB Controller), Lian Li UNI FAN TL LCD 120 (X1 Exhaust) + Acer 24" Nitro XV242F 540 Hz Monitor

Custom RGB interface for Team colous - for the players to implement.

Vendors will supply the Programme via a M.2 and this will be inserted to the systems (Diagnostics will be run)
